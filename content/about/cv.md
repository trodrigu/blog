## Open Source
#### [TossBounty](https://tossbounty.com)
After seeing a problem with funding open source, TossBounty was conceived and built with Elixir/Phoenix, and Elm along with Stripe for processing to allow maintainers to easily create campaigns.  Code is at github.com/trodrigu/toss_bounty and github.com/trodrigu/toss_bounty_frontend.

---
#### [Freegex](https://freegex.com)
Many times when processing large amounts of data a regex pattern was needed to parse out something specific.  In order to scratch this itch, freegex.com was created.  The code is at https://github.com/trodrigu
